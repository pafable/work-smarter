# Work Smarter Intro to Devsecops: 

Code in this repo purposely has vulnerabilties so I can demonstrate how to detect them.

If you want to follow along these are the tools I will be using:

- PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
  (feel free to use whatever text editor or IDE you're comfortable with, vscode is a great alternative)

- tfsec : https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec

- snyk: https://snyk.io/
